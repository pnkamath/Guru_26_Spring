# Awk Files

Using the `S1.awk` script, we found that every row in `pages_block_dirty.csv` has every field listed in the header of the file. While Each column has a value, `S2.awk` shows that there are 2 columns, 7 and 8, which have a total of 23 rows that contain the value `?` in one of those columns. Through `S3.awk` we were able to easily see that the only column which has the same value in every row is the `DATASET_ID` column which contains the ID of the dataset being analyzed. `S4.awk` reports that there are 4 rows which contain class labels which are invalid. Using the `S5.awk` script we were also able to see that there were 124 duplicate rows in the dataset. 

# Python Checks
Similar to what was found in part A of the homework, check A showed that the only constant column in the dataset was the `DATASET_ID` column. Check B showed that the `BLACKAND` and `BLACKPIX` columns were correlated as well as the `LENGHT` and `WIDTH` columns. Check C showed that all columns other than the `DATASET_ID` column and the `class!` column contained at least one outlier value. Check D reported that the `AREA`, `BLACKAND`, `BLACKPIX`, `HEIGHT`, `LENGHT`, `P_AND`, and `P_BLACK` columns all contained at least one value which conflicted with the other values in their row. Check E showed us that the `HEIGHT`, `P_AND`, `P_BLACK`, and `class!` columns contained at least 1 implausible value. Check F showed that each column was hit at least once during the prior checks. 

Check G returned 508 rows which contained at least one value which was an outlier from the rest of the values in its column. Check H reported that 159 rows which had values inconsistent with others with the same class. Check I reported 449 rows which had values which were outliers when compared to rows within the same class. Check K showed that there were 39 rows which contained at least one implausible value. Checks L and M both returned 817 rows which were included in the output of checks G-K.
