The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog. The dog was very lazy and the fox was very quick. 
In software engineering, the principle of separation of concerns is very important. The principle 
states that software should be organized so that each part addresses a separate concern. When we 
separate concerns, we make software easier to maintain and easier to understand. The separation 
of concerns principle is fundamental to good software design. Many design patterns exist to help 
with the separation of concerns. For example, the Model-View-Controller pattern separates the 
data model from the user interface and the control logic. Another example is the separation of 
business logic from presentation logic. These separations make the code more modular and more 
testable. Good software engineering practices always emphasize the importance of separating 
different concerns into different modules or components.
